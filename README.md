# Exploring-Class-Agnostic-Pixels-for-Scribble-Supervised-High-Resolution-Salient-Object-Detection
This repository is set for the "Exploring Class-Agnostic Pixels for Scribble-Supervised High-Resolution Salient Object Detection" , which is the first network for high-resolution salient object detection (HRSOD) under scribble-supervised so far. We remaking the first scribbles-labeled HRSOD datasets.
Scr-HRSOD and HRSOD Datasets
====
The proposed first scribble-supervised high-resolution salient object detection datasts, Scr-HRSDO, is pubilc available in [Baidu Netdisk]
Benchmark Testing Dataset (DUT, DUTS, ECSSD, HKU-IS, PASCAL-S, SOD, THUR):

Ackonwledgement
=======
Our dataset was re-labeled via Scribble based on the HRSOD datasets, thanks to the authors's contribution. I would also like to sincere thanks Dr. Jing Zhang for her guidance and help in the production of the datasets.
