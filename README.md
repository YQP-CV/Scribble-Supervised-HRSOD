# Exploring-Class-Agnostic-Pixels-for-Scribble-Supervised-High-Resolution-Salient-Object-Detection
This repository is set for the "Exploring Class-Agnostic Pixels for Scribble-Supervised High-Resolution Salient Object Detection" , which is the first network for high-resolution salient object detection (HRSOD) under scribble-supervised so far. We remaking the first scribbles-labeled HRSOD datasets.
